* About
I'm a Software Engineer working at [[https://factual.com][Factual]] in Los Angeles, CA.

I previously worked at Hillary For America, the [[https://www.turing.io/][Turing School]], and LivingSocial. At least one of these endeavors did not end in abject disaster.

Before programming I studied Architecture and worked for a while at a small firm in Berkeley.

In another life I would be a fly fishing guide.
