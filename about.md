## About

I'm a Software Engineer in Los Angeles. During the day I work on Places Data for [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/).

Outside of work I sometimes surf (poorly), chase [carp in the LA river](https://twitter.com/worace/status/1376588367152865281) (unsuccessfully), or hack on side projects, usually with a geospatial bent.

Lately I've been working on [Contour](https://contour.app/), an application for sharing and editing geospatial data. Sometimes I livestream some of this project work on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/worace).
