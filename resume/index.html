<h3>Factual - Software Engineer (Jan 2017 - Present)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.factual.com/">Factual</a> makes a suite of location data products including a global Places (POI) dataset.</p>
<p>I had always been interested in working on tech in the mapping or location space as well as doing more &#8220;Data Engineering&#8221; and Factual has given me a chance to do both.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fast-moving place with more projects to go around than people, and I worked on quite a few projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Web-based &#8220;workbench&#8221; application for tuning a geospatial ML model. Included a pure PL/pgSQL-based port of C++ featurization logic to enable feature development with PostGIS rather than C++. Clojure, React, PostGIS, Mapbox GL JS.</li>
  <li>Android &#8220;Data Collection App&#8221; for gathering training data for spatial ML models</li>
  <li>Web-based data moderation and annotation platform. 2 million annotations and growing. Rails, Postgres, React, GraphQL.</li>
  <li>Distributed tiling system for building spatial tilesets to serve mobile and API clients. Turned ~100G of GeoJSON into ~20G of binary tiles. Clojure, Apache Spark, Thrift, JTS, Spatial4J. I rewrote this system from Java and Hadoop MapReduce to Clojure and Spark.</li>
  <li>ETL pipeline for populating Factual&#8217;s spatial data warehouse. Ruby, PostGIS, OpenStreetMap, my own ruby shell scripting library, <a href="https://github.com/worace/coque">Coque</a>.</li>
  <li>Model for optimizing POI location placement at scale. Included spatial scoring rules, tiling infrastructure, and a web-based workbench UI. I developed a rules-based version then helped a coworker convert it to a regression-based ML model. Scala, Spark, H3, JTS, SKLearn, PostGIS, Mapbox GL JS.</li>
</ul>
<p>During this time I got really interested in geospatial and mapping tech, and committed to working on a few geo-related side projects, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://contour.app/">contour.app</a> - A web-based PostGIS console and GIS dataset storage tool.</li>
  <li><a href="github.com/worace/geoq">geoq</a> - A streaming geospatial CLI for working with WKT, GeoJSON, and Geohashes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hillary for America - Software Engineer (July - Nov 2016)</h3>
<p>4 month tenure on a campaign tech team. Surprisingly normal work environment, with a lot of industry veterans on leave from various &#8220;typical&#8221; tech jobs. But also 7 day work weeks. Lots of professional practice knowledge sharing thanks to team&#8217;s diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p>I worked on a series of full-stack and backend web projects including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A form-builder application for soliciting donations and list signups. Rails, RDS, SQS</li>
  <li>Improvements to polling place lookup API. Golang, Melissa Address Data</li>
  <li>A service for managing bulk SMS-based donation campaigns. Python, Flask, SQS</li>
  <li>A vanity site for subscribing to automated donations in response to Trump tweets. Node, Express, Knex, RDS, SQS</li>
</ul>
<h3>Turing School of Software and Design - Instructor (Oct 2014 - May 2016)</h3>
<p>Instructor for daily full-group, in-person class sessions on CS fundamentals, Object Oriented Programming and Design, and Web Development at a non-profit code school.</p>
<p>Lots of time spent teaching and working with new developers, writing detailed lesson plans and tutorials, and boning up on CS and SWE fundamentals.</p>
<h3>LivingSocial - Software Apprentice and Engineer (Mar 2012 - Oct. 2014)</h3>
<p>Joined as a student at an in-house code bootcamp called Hungry Academy, then worked on the main consumer web team as a Junior Software Engineer.</p>
<p>Worked on the company&#8217;s main Rails application. Lots of performance optimization and monolith to microservice migration. Ruby, JS, Redis, Memcached. Lots of migrating synchronous web-based processes to asynchronous queue-based ones.</p>
<h3>Marcy Wong Donn Logan Architects - Architectural Minion (July 2011 - Apr 2012)</h3>
<p>Abortive architectural career. Worked at a small firm in Berkeley, CA and realized that architecture school is much more fun than architecture job. Helped me decide to pursue technology more aggressively.</p>
<h3>Yale University - B.A., Architecture (2011)</h3>
<p>Did lots of goofy design projects in Architecture studios. Worked on the Yale Daily News. Took a few CS classes.</p>
