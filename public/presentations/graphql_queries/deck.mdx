# Working with GraphQL Queries

---

## Goals:

* Dispell some myths
* Build a mental model for working with GraphQL schemas
* Practice writing queries
* Practice reading GraphQL Docs
* **Not focused on server-side tools + implementation today.**

---

## 1. Background

#### [GraphQL: A Query Language for your API](https://graphql.org/)

* GraphQL is a specification for a JSON-based data protocol
* 2 parts:
  * **Schema-Definition** (Server Side) -- Define a typed JSON document your server provides
  * **Query Language** (Client Side** -- Request document fields and specify parameters

## 2. Myths + Fears

* Graph**QL** != S**QL**
* Despite having "Query Language" in the name, the query language is much simpler than something like SQL.

</div>

```json
{
    "viewer": {
        "login": "worace",
        "location": "Los Angeles, CA"
    }
}
```

</Split>


---

## 2. Type System

* Returned data in GraphQL is all just JSON
* Query Language enables selecting subsets of fields and providing arguments
* "JSON Filtering and Parameterization DSL" would be a better name but does not sound as trendy
